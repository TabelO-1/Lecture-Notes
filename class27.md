# ✍️ Notes
1. List some of JavaScript's data types:
- Array, String, Boolean, Object, Function, Symbol, Undefined, Null

2. In JavaScript, ______ __________ is an object.
- All Javascript values, except pro,otoves, are objects.

3. What are "JavaScript Primitives"?
- A primitive is a value that has no properties or methods. A primtive data type is data that has a primtive value

4. How many primitive data types are there?
- There are 7 primtive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.

5. What are the three JavaScript Primative Wrapper types?
- JavaScript provides three primitive wrapper types: Boolean, Number, and String types.

6. What does a JavaScript Primative Wrapper do?
- The primtive wrappers make it easier to call JavaScript's built-in methods on the primitive value.

7. What is the Primative Wrapper doing under the hood when you call a method on a variable that holds a number, a string, or a boolean?
- JavaScript will create an object of a corresponding type. Then call the method on the instance. And lastly, Javascript deletes the instance immediately after it is finished and moves onto the next script.

8. What are functions that are binded to an object called?
