# ✍️ Notes

How to Solve a Coding Challenge:

1. 
    * What method or concept are we learning about this week
    * Look it up on MDN or W3Schools
    * Search for articles on Medium about the thod/topic.
    * Watch a YouTube video on it.
    * Review your Lecture Notes from class.
    * Participate in discussions with other developers about code challenges. 
2. 
    * Read through the problem
    * Indentify suggestive key words/hints
    * Indentify the requirements for solving the challenge
    * Indentify the inputs
        * Inputs are the arguments our function will take in when it is called.
    * Indentify the outputs
        * Outputs are what we are expecting our function to return back to use when it is finished running
    * Biew the test for input/output examples
3. Create a step-by-step plan (algorithm) for how you'll solvie it
    * Think about how this week's method/topic can be applied to solve the code challenge.
    * Create a visual example with inputs (like a whiteboard) to help wrap your brain around each step your function is taking
    * Create a checklist (in plain english) of everything this function needs to accomplish
        * You've already indetified the requirements in the step above. Now all you have to do is fill in the tiny details.
    * The most practiccal way of creating an algorithm  is often to focus on the example input/output in your visual
    * You should consider the steps that your algorithm will take to use the inout in moving towards the output
    * This process of working through the problem yourslef, and noticing the steps you take along the way, should naturally help you flesh out the steps that will be part of your algorithm
4. Carry out the plan and write actual code.
    * Using your algorithm checklist, write code that will accomplish one task at a time.
    * Complete your function
    * Correct any syntax/linter errors
    * Don't forget to return your solution!
    * Get the test to pass.
5. Look back and possibly refactor your solution if it could be better
    * Is the test for this code challenge passing?
    * Does your solution meet all the requirements for this code challenge?
    * Does your solution use this week's method/topic to solve the code challenge
    * Can you understand it at a glance? Does it make sense? Is it readable?
    * Can you think of other ways to refactor? Make it a one-liner?
    * How have other people solved this problem
